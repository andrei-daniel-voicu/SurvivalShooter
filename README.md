# GFX Framework

## :sparkles: Introduction

This project is a tiny graphics framework used by the Computer Graphics Department of the Polytechnic University of Bucharest.
It is currently used as teaching and study material for a number of courses of increasing complexity, including, but not limited to:

-   **`EGC`** Elements of Computer Graphics, BSc year 3 &mdash; [course materials (RO)](https://ocw.cs.pub.ro/courses/egc)
-   **`SPG`** Graphics Processing Systems, BSc year 4 &mdash; [course materials (RO)](https://ocw.cs.pub.ro/courses/spg)

The functionality is split into several modules of increasing difficulty (`m1`, `m2`, etc.).

You can read more about it [in the docs](docs/home.md).

It has missing and closed-source functionality that you will need to implement.

The code is cross-platform, and supports the following architectures:

-   Windows: `i686`, `x86_64`, `arm64`
-   Linux: `i686`, `x86_64`, `arm64`
-   macOS: `x86_64`, `arm64`
